Final Project for CSCI 2270 Spring 2016


Project	Summary

This code was built as part of a Final Project for CSCI 2270 - Data Structures. The program uses a linked list to create a league standings of the English Premier League, which is the English soccer league. The program can display different types of tables based on the current 2016 EPL teams, add scores of a game between any 2 teams, add teams, and delete teams. When a game score is entered, the winning team receives 3 points and the losing team receives 0 points and each team's number of games played increases by 1. If the teams tie, each team receives 1 point and another game played. When a new score is added, the program rearranges the linked list so teams are re-ordered by points.

Open issues/bugs

There is a section currently commented out in case 5 of the main file because the rebalancing function does not work as planned. When the section is uncommented and the rebalancing function is used, the team that is rebalanced is somehow deleted from the linked list.
